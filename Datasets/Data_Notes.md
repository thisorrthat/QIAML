Due to their size, all data set images are first cropped and pre-processed using the auto_crop.py. This fucntion isolates the green fluorsecnet channel (the dectection channel of our FAM fluorphore) applied an adaptive blurring and contrasting to the images to improve visual represenation. The images are then cropped based on contours of the image, and saved as a 2D numpy array in an .npy file. To access the images, the get_data.py file reads in the .npy and saves the data arrays as either a numpy array or a pandas dataframe. The data available is triplicate images of the end point of the RPA reaction. To ensure the train and test splits contain all data in the range of interst (3-10,000 cp) the triplicate data is split into train and test groups. Here the data in AB,BC, or AC represent the train groups while A, B, or C are the test groups for the training sets BC, AC,AB respectivily.
